**General Information**

The PDF reader allows for all those in the room to open a file and have it shown to them only. Letting each player display their own file personally, within the OBR interface.  Using the Annotation editor, you can make notes/drawings on the file and save it.

On Mobile, a long press should simulate a right click to pull up the context menu when on the annotation editor.

(Note: Embedded scripts will not work.)
